          First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

          Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <span class="boldMe">current fire restrictions.</span>

          We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can pay the <span class="boldMe">park entrance fee</span> upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).
